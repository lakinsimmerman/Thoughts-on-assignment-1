# Thoughts-on-assignment-1

I struggled at first with this assignment because I was wasn't quite sure if my topic of choice was fitting enough for this assignment. 
After meeting with you though, I felt much more confident in it and the direction that it lead me in. 
I honestly think it went well as far as writing everything is concerned. 
I tried to think of every little detail or question that someone would ask in order to make the final piece as specific as possible. 
The technique was weird, but I got used to it after working in github for a while. 
I know my effort was there when trying to make the final piece as complete as possible. 
I have been hoping that it was everything that you were expecting since first assignments always leave a lot of room for questioning how a professor wants certain things done. 
I look forward to seeing if I'm on the right track with this class.
